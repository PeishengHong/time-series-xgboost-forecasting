# Time Series Forecasting with XGBoost

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This project applies machine learning techniques to forecast hourly energy consumption using XGBoost. It covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Hourly Energy Consumption" dataset, which contains energy usage data recorded hourly. The data is publicly available on Kaggle.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies

- XGBoost
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## ðŸ’¼ Business Impact

This project provides actionable insights for energy management and operational efficiency:

- Optimized Energy Planning: Accurate hourly energy consumption forecasts help utility companies plan power generation and distribution efficiently, reducing overproduction or shortages.
- Cost Reduction: Better predictions enable cost savings by minimizing unnecessary energy production and peak-time surcharges.
- Enhanced Grid Stability: Forecasting helps prevent grid overloads and ensures reliable electricity supply to customers.
- Demand Response Strategies: Businesses and utilities can implement strategies to shift energy usage away from peak hours, improving energy efficiency and sustainability.
- Sustainability & Emissions Reduction: Efficient energy management reduces waste and lowers carbon emissions associated with excess energy production.
